# What is stop and wait over UDP?

# simple error-control for reliable data over unreliable transport layer by sending
# one packet at a time. 

# How? Sender transmits a data packet and waits for ACK before sending the next.
# Also uses timers to retransmit data if no ACK received.
SEQ__ID_SIZE = 4 # 4 bytes for seuqence ID
MESSAGE_SIZE = PACKET_SIZE - SEQ__ID_SIZE # 1020 bytes for message
TIMEOUT = 1.0 # not sure how long we must wait for timeout

# Steps
# 1. Transmit data packet
# 2. start a timer and wait
# 3. wait and receive ACK (if successful)
# 4. if receive ack stop timer and send next packet
# If timeout, retransmit packet and restart timer
# Send FIN packet when done
